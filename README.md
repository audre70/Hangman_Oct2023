# Hangman_Oct2023

This sketch was one of my weekly assignments entitled Assignment 5: Array Methods and Strings. This is a rudimentary hangman game that helped me better familiarize myself with array and string methods. 

The requirements of the assignment were to feature at least two of the following:
- An array method (ex. push, slice, shift, unshift, etc.)
- A string method (ex. length, substring, split, etc.) 
- An interactive component (via mouse or keyboard) that changes a visible and/or audible change
